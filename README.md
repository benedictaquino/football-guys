# Mapping the Clutch Gene

The goal of this project is to implement the Mapper algorithm on NFL Fantasy
Football data in order to visualize and analyze the point cloud data. Ideally, 
analyzing the simplical complices that result from my implementation of the 
Mapper algorithm will yield a meaningful and novel way to group together 
players. Using information gained from topological data analysis, I aim to make 
a model thatoptimizes daily fantasy line-ups.
